# Attendance WebSocket Issues - Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified

### 1. Attendance Disappearing After Hard Refresh
**Problem**: Users were experiencing attendance data disappearing after hard refresh, with toggled attendance sometimes persisting through soft refresh but vanishing on hard refresh.

**Root Causes**:
- Cache invalidation timing issues
- Race conditions between cached data and fresh WebSocket data
- Pending offline changes not being properly applied to cached data
- Stale state persisting between sessions

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Improved Cache Management**: 
  - Reduced cache staleness threshold from 30s to 15s
  - Added `hasPendingChanges` flag to cache entries
  - Clear stale state before loading new data
- **Enhanced Offline Sync**:
  - Apply pending offline changes to cached data on load
  - Remove synced changes from pending queue when WebSocket updates arrive
  - Better state dependency management in useEffect hooks
- **State Clearing**: Clear attendance and visitor state before loading new data to prevent ghost data

### 2. WebSocket Authentication Security Vulnerability
**Problem**: Server was trusting client-provided authentication data without verification, potentially allowing unauthorized access.

**Root Cause**: The WebSocket authentication middleware was accepting client `authData` without validating JWT tokens.

**Fix Applied**:
- **Secure JWT Validation**: 
  - Extract JWT token from cookies (same as REST API)
  - Verify token using `jwt.verify` with proper secret
  - Validate user exists and is active in database
  - Cross-check client authData with verified token data
  - Proper error handling for expired/invalid tokens

### 3. WebSocket Connection Failures
**Problem**: Occasional connection failures with error messages like `WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost/?token=...' failed`

**Root Causes**:
- Inadequate timeout and retry configuration
- Transport ordering issues
- URL construction problems with default ports

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Improved Connection Resilience**:
  - Increased timeout from 10s to 15s
  - More reconnection attempts (3 â†’ 5)
  - Better transport ordering (WebSocket first, then polling)
  - Enhanced error handling with specific error types
- **URL Construction**: Fixed port handling for default HTTP/HTTPS ports
- **Better Logging**: Added comprehensive connection debugging

### 4. Offline Storage Race Conditions
**Problem**: Offline changes could be lost or incorrectly applied during connection restoration.

**Root Cause**: Poor synchronization between offline storage, WebSocket updates, and UI state.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Synchronized Pending Changes**: Remove pending changes when matching WebSocket updates arrive
- **Enhanced Cache Updates**: Include pending changes in cache data
- **Improved State Management**: Better dependency arrays and state clearing

## Code Changes Made

### AttendancePage.tsx
1. **Enhanced Cache Management**:
   - Clear state before loading new data
   - Apply pending changes to cached data
   - Reduce cache staleness threshold
   - Add `hasPendingChanges` flag to cache entries

2. **Improved Offline Sync**:
   - Remove pending changes when WebSocket updates arrive
   - Include pending changes in dependency arrays
   - Better handling of offline storage persistence

### WebSocket Server (websocket.js)
1. **Secure Authentication**:
   - JWT token extraction from cookies
   - Database user validation
   - Cross-verification of client auth data
   - Proper error handling for auth failures

### WebSocket Client (WebSocketContext.tsx)
1. **Connection Resilience**:
   - Improved timeout and retry configuration
   - Better transport ordering
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Fixed URL construction for default ports

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Attendance Persistence**:
   - Toggle attendance for multiple people
   - Perform soft refresh - data should persist
   - Perform hard refresh - data should still persist
   - Test with network disconnection/reconnection

2. **WebSocket Security**:
   - Test with expired tokens
   - Test with invalid tokens
   - Test with mismatched auth data

3. **Connection Reliability**:
   - Test in different network conditions
   - Test with browser developer tools network throttling
   - Test PWA vs browser mode
   - Test multiple tabs simultaneously

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Attendance data should persist through both soft and hard refreshes**
2. **WebSocket connections should be more reliable with better error recovery**
3. **Offline changes should properly sync when connection is restored**
4. **Authentication should be secure and properly validated**
5. **No more unauthorized WebSocket connections**

## Environment Variables

Ensure `VITE_USE_WEBSOCKETS` is set appropriately:
- `'true'` - WebSocket only mode
- `'fallback'` - WebSocket with API fallback (recommended)
- `'false'` - API only mode

## Monitoring

Watch for these log messages to verify fixes:
- `ðŸ“± Loading cached attendance data` - Cache loading
- `ðŸ”Œ [WEBSOCKET] Removing pending change` - Offline sync working
- `âœ… WebSocket authentication successful` - Secure auth working
- `ðŸ”„ Force reconnecting WebSocket` - Connection recovery

The fixes address the core issues of data persistence, security vulnerabilities, and connection reliability while maintaining backwards compatibility and proper error handling.
