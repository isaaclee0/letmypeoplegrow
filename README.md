- Git

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/isaaclee0/letmypeoplegrow.git
   cd letmypeoplegrow
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Server settings used by the application
   cp server/.env.example server/.env

   # Docker Compose interpolation (including the credential-encryption key)
   cp .env.example .env

   # Edit both files with the settings for this deployment
   nano server/.env
   nano .env
   ```

   **Required for Authentication:**
   - **Brevo API Key**: For email-based authentication
   - **Crazytel API Key** (optional): For SMS-based authentication
   - **Crazytel From Number** (optional): Your SMS sender number

   **Optional Integrations:**
   - **OpenAI API Key** or **Anthropic API Key**: For AI insights feature
   - **Elvanto API Key**: For member/gathering imports

   **Note**: The `.env` file is excluded from git for security. Never commit your actual API keys.

3. **Start the development environment**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

   This will start all services:
   - React client (port 3000)
   - Node.js server (port 3001)
   - MariaDB database (port 3307 → 3306)
   - Nginx reverse proxy (port 80)
   - phpMyAdmin (port 8080)
   - Admin panel (port 7777, localhost only)

4. **Access the application**
   - **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost (via Nginx)
   - **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001 (or http://localhost/api via Nginx)
   - **Database**: localhost:3307
   - **phpMyAdmin**: http://localhost:8080
   - **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:7777 (localhost only)

5. **Initial setup**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000
   - Complete the onboarding process
   - Create your first admin user
   - Configure church settings

6. **View logs**
   ```bash
   # All services
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f

   # Specific service
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f client
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f server
   ```

### Mobile Testing

To test the application on mobile devices during development:

1. **Install Cloudflare Tunnel** (cloudflared)
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared

   # Linux
   wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64
   ```

2. **Start a quick tunnel**
   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:80
   ```

   This will generate a temporary public URL (e.g., `https://xyz.trycloudflare.com`) that you can access from your mobile device.

3. **Alternative: Local network access**
   - Find your computer's local IP address (`ipconfig` on Windows, `ifconfig` on Mac/Linux)
   - Access the app at `http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:3000` from devices on the same network

### Production Deployment

1. **Build the production images**
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your production values
   ```

3. **Start the production environment**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

```

#### Integration credential key rollout and rollback

Generate the integration credential encryption key once:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

The command output becomes `INTEGRATION_CREDENTIALS_KEY`. Treat it as a secret: back it up separately from the application and database backups, configure the same value on every server replica, and keep it stable across restarts and redeployments. Losing, regenerating, or inconsistently configuring this key makes saved Planning Center and Elvanto credentials unrecoverable.

How the key is supplied depends on how the server is started:

- **Direct Node.js startup:** put the key in `server/.env`, change into `server/`, and run `npm start`. The server loads that file from its working directory.
- **Docker Compose:** either export the key in the shell that runs Compose or put it in the project-root `.env` file (copy `.env.example` first). Compose resolves `${INTEGRATION_CREDENTIALS_KEY}` before containers start. A service-level `env_file: ./server/.env` does not provide values for that interpolation, and the explicit `environment` mapping takes precedence over `env_file`. Both Compose files therefore reject a missing or empty key instead of silently overriding it with an empty value.

For example, supply the already-generated value to the current shell without printing it back:

```bash
export INTEGRATION_CREDENTIALS_KEY='the-backed-up-base64-key'
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

For rollout, use this order:

1. Back up every church database and generate and separately back up the key.
2. Configure the identical `INTEGRATION_CREDENTIALS_KEY` on every replica before deploying code that saves or migrates integration credentials. For Compose, use the invoking shell or project-root `.env`; do not rely on `server/.env` for Compose interpolation.
3. Deploy and verify startup logs do not report a missing, invalid, or mismatched integration key.
4. Only after that verification, connect new integrations or allow existing per-user credentials to migrate into encrypted church-level storage.

During this upgrade, an existing church with an enabled scheduled Planning Center batch and no explicit provider authority is migrated to Planning Center authority so its unattended sync does not silently stop. Its Planning Center-linked people and families then become strictly managed: edits, archive/reactivation, merge, and deletion must be made in Planning Center and synced back. An existing explicit Elvanto or Planning Center authority is preserved; the migration never activates two authorities.

For rollback, stop integration writes and scheduled sync first, retain the exact same `INTEGRATION_CREDENTIALS_KEY` on all replicas, and restore the pre-rollout application together with its compatible database backup if that version cannot read provider-neutral connection data. Never generate a replacement key as part of rollback. After restoring, verify ordinary attendance access and each configured integration before re-enabling scheduled sync.

### Client Environment Variables

These are built into the client at build time:

```env
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.5.3                   # App version (from VERSION file)
PORT=3000                                # Dev server port
CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true                 # File watching in Docker
WATCHPACK_POLLING=true                   # Webpack polling
FAST_REFRESH=false                       # React Fast Refresh
```

### Docker Compose Environment Variables

Set these in the invoking shell or the project-root `.env` before running `docker-compose`:

```bash
VERSION=1.5.3                            # App version (optional, defaults to VERSION file)
INTEGRATION_CREDENTIALS_KEY=...          # Required; one stable base64-encoded 32-byte key
```

The key is required by both Compose files. `server/.env` remains the application environment file, but it is not an input to Compose interpolation.

## Architecture & Key Concepts

### Multi-Tenancy and Church Isolation

The application uses a robust church isolation system to ensure complete data separation between churches:

- **Church ID System**: Each church has a unique `church_id`
  - Development: Simple IDs (e.g., `devch1`, `redcc1`)
  - Production: Secure IDs with format `{base}_{random_hex}` (e.g., `dev_abc123def456`)
- **Middleware Enforcement**: `churchIsolation.js` validates church context on every request
- **Database Filtering**: ALL queries automatically include `WHERE church_id = ?`
- **Token-Based**: Church ID is embedded in JWT tokens and validated server-side

**Critical**: When adding new database tables or queries, ALWAYS include `church_id` filtering.

### Authentication Flow

Passwordless authentication system:

1. User enters email/mobile → Server sends one-time code (OTC) via Brevo/Crazytel
2. User enters code → Server validates and returns JWT token in HTTP-only cookie
3. Client stores nothing (tokens in secure cookies only)
4. Automatic token refresh before expiration
5. All requests include church_id validation

### Real-time Updates

WebSocket-based synchronization for attendance tracking:

- Server broadcasts changes to all connected clients in the same church
- Rooms scoped by `church_id` and `gathering_id`
- Automatic reconnection on disconnect
- Events: `attendance:update`, `visitor:update`, `headcount:update`

### PWA and Service Worker

Progressive Web App features:

- Service worker generated at build time with unique cache names (version + timestamp)
- Offline support for static resources
- Automatic update detection and user notifications
- Install prompts for mobile and desktop
- Version display in UI for troubleshooting

**Build process**: `npm run build` in client directory runs `generate-sw.js` then Vite build.

### Database Schema Highlights

All tables include `church_id` for multi-tenancy:

- **users**: Accounts with role-based permissions (admin, coordinator, attendance_taker)
- **gathering_types**: Services with scheduling, supports attendance_type ('standard' | 'headcount')
- **individuals**: Members and visitors with people_type ('regular' | 'local_visitor' | 'traveller_visitor')
- **families**: Family groupings
- **attendance_sessions**: Session records per gathering per date
- **attendance_records**: Individual check-ins (standard mode)
- **headcount_records**: Headcount entries (headcount mode)
- **visitor_config**: Church-specific visitor timeout thresholds

### Known Large Files (Refactoring Planned)

The codebase has three large files that are functional but could benefit from refactoring:

- `client/src/pages/PeoplePage.tsx` (4,557 lines) - Member management
- `client/src/pages/AttendancePage.tsx` (4,272 lines) - Attendance tracking
- `server/routes/attendance.js` (2,491 lines) - Attendance endpoints

See the refactoring plan in `/Users/isaaclee/.claude/plans/sorted-discovering-swan.md` for details on compartmentalization strategy.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Version Not Updating
If the PWA shows an old version:
1. Check `VERSION` file at project root
2. Verify `VITE_APP_VERSION` is set in docker-compose.dev.yml
3. Rebuild client container: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build client`
4. Clear browser cache and service worker

### Dependencies Not Installing
After adding npm dependencies:
```bash
# Rebuild the affected container
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build [client|server]
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d [client|server]
```

### Database Connection Issues
Check database health:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec db mariadb -u church_user -pchurch_password church_attendance
```

### WebSocket Not Connecting
- Verify server is running: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f server`
- Check browser console for connection errors
- Ensure client URL is correctly configured in server/.env

### Church Isolation Not Working
All database queries must include `church_id` filtering. Check:
- Middleware is applied to route
- JWT token includes valid church_id
- Query includes `WHERE church_id = ?` with parameterized value
