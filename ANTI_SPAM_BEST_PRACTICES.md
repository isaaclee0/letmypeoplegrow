## 🔧 Required Infrastructure Setup

### 1. Domain Authentication (Critical)
Set up these DNS records for your domain to improve deliverability:

#### SPF Record
```
TXT @ "v=spf1 include:spf.brevo.com ~all"
```

**For letmypeoplegrow.com.au:**
```
TXT @ "v=spf1 include:spf.brevo.com ~all"
```

#### DKIM Record
Configure DKIM through your Brevo account:
1. Go to Brevo dashboard → Senders & IP → Senders
2. Add your domain
3. Follow the DKIM setup instructions
4. Add the provided CNAME record to your DNS

#### DMARC Record
```
TXT _dmarc "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com; ruf=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com; sp=quarantine; adkim=r; aspf=r;"
```

**For letmypeoplegrow.com.au:**
```
TXT _dmarc "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@letmypeoplegrow.com.au; ruf=mailto:dmarc@letmypeoplegrow.com.au; sp=quarantine; adkim=r; aspf=r;"
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Add these to your environment configuration:

```bash
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_FROM=hello@letmypeoplegrow.com.au
EMAIL_FROM_NAME="Let My People Grow"
EMAIL_DOMAIN=letmypeoplegrow.com.au
CHURCH_NAME="Let My People Grow"

# Brevo Configuration
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key
```
